            <h2 id='history'>The History of Space Invaders</h2>
            <p>Space Invaders is a Japanese shooting video game released in 1978 by Taito. It was developed by Tomohiro Nishikado,
                who was inspired by other media: Breakout, The War of the Worlds, and Star Wars. The games was one of the forerunners
                 of modern video gaming and helped expand the video game industry from a novelty to a global industry.
                The game Space Invaders became an immediate hit when it was released in 1978. In the original planning for the game,
                 they had planned to have the aliens be human soldiers. Taito figured that they did not want to send the message that 
                 shooting humans was ok, so they changed it to aliens.</p>
            <h2 id='backstory'>Backstory</h2>
            <p>Aliens are invading, it's up to you to save the world! This is a very real threat - extraterrestrials invade the Earth either to 
                exterminate and supplant human life, enslave it under an intense state, harvest people for food, 
                steal the planet's resources, or destroy the planet altogether.</p>

            <h2 id='controls'>Controls</h2>
            <p>The controls of this game are simple. Use the arrow keys to move left and right, press spacebar to shoot!</p>

            <h2 id='tips'>Tips and tricks</h2>
            <p>This game requires accuracy and precision to win, you need to make your shots matter. You will find that your bullets are limited,
                due to the power required to fire, there is a cool down period between shots (only one bullet on the screen at a time. I swear this is a feature not a bug.....)
            </p>

            <h2 id='upgrades'>Purchase upgrades</h2>
            <p>Upgrades coming soon! Do you want new skins? A stronger weapon? New environments? I, just like
                every other video game company, will happily take your money for these easy to implement upgrades!
            </p>
